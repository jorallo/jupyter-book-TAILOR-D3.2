**Note from Francesca:** I tried two different ways to list terms.
1) *Dimensions of Explanations* --> using this method it will appear in the left menÃ¹, but it requires two steps to reach the page with the definition
2) *Model Specific / Model Agnostic* --> they won't appear in the menu, but they are direct links to the right entry
